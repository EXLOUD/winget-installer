## üìã Coding Standards

### PowerShell Scripts

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation
- Follow [PowerShell Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dev-cross-plat/writing-portable-cmdlets)
- Use **PascalCase** for function names
- Use **camelCase** for variables
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Use **Try-Catch** blocks for error handling
- Prefer **explicit** over implicit operations

Example:
```powershell
function Install-WingetDependency {
    param(
        [string]$FilePath,
        [string]$Architecture
    )
    
    try {
        Write-Host "[INFO] Installing dependency for $Architecture..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
        Add-AppxPackage -Path $FilePath -ErrorAction Stop
        Write-Host "[SUCCESS] Dependency installed successfully" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "[ERROR] Failed to install dependency: $_" -ForegroundColor Red
        throw
    }
}
```

### Batch Files

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **UPPERCASE** for environment variables
- Add **comments** using `::` for important sections
- Use **error checking** with `%errorlevel%`
- Quote paths that might contain spaces

Example:
```batch
:: Check if file exists
if not exist "%SCRIPT_PATH%" (
  echo [ERROR] Script not found: %SCRIPT_PATH%
  exit /b 1
)
```

### General Guidelines

- **Keep functions small** and focused
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Add error handling** for all operations
- **Test edge cases** when possible
- **Document complex logic** with comments
- **Follow existing code patterns** in the project
